# Excel-Ecommerce-Project
📊 Ecommerce Supply Chain Analysis in Excel

## 📖 **Background**
DataCo Analysis Group is a leading business analytics consultancy. This project, "Streamline & Spotlight," focuses on how supply chain operations and digital consumer behaviour are connected.

We use two key datasets:
📦 Supply Chain Data – Includes sales, logistics, and delivery details.
🌍 Digital Access Logs – Tracks customer online interactions and preferences.

By analysing these datasets, businesses can improve their supply chains and better understand how customers engage with their products online.

## 🎯 **Objective**
This project uses Microsoft Excel to:

- ✅ Clean and merge data for better analysis.
- ✅ Find trends and patterns in supply chain and digital engagement.
- ✅ Create an interactive dashboard to visualise key insights.
- ✅ Suggest improvements for business growth and efficiency.

The goal is to help businesses make smarter decisions about product management, marketing, and customer relationships by connecting supply chain performance with digital behaviour.
